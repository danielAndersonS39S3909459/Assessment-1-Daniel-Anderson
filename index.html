    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
    <img src="image002.jpg" width="144" height="152">
    <p><b>Personal background:</b>I grew up in Zimbabwe on a farm north of Harare and immigrated to Australia in 2005 due to political turmoil in the country.
      Upon completing my schooling, I joined the Army and attended the Australian Defence Force Academy in 2008, where I studied engineering (Civil). Upon graduating
      from my training in 2012 I worked as a Supply Officer and in my later years specialised in Logistic Information Systems.</p>
    <p><b>Interest In IT:</b>My interest in IT started when I went to university the first time. One of our early classes was in using MATLAB for doing our calculations and modelling. It was far superior in terms of accuracy, speed, and error checking compared to doing work by hand. From then on, I was always looking for ways IT could make my work easier. I have relied upon IT systems for my whole career in logistics with experience across supply, maintenance, operations planning and finance tools. For the last two years I have been working on a large IT project, the Defence Enterprise Resource Planning program, which has led me to the decision that I would like to pursue a career more focused on IT. This decision to pursue IT is why I have commenced my studies at RMIT and specifically RMIT because it allows me to study while I work full time, though balancing the two can be hard at times. During my studies I am seeking foundational knowledge in IT as well as a better understanding of IT security and Software development. </p>
