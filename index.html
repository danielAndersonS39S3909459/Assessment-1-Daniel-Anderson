<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<h2>Personal background: </h2>

<p>I grew up in Zimbabwe on a farm north of Harare and immigrated to Australia in 2005 due to political turmoil in the country. Upon completing my schooling, I joined the Army and attended the Australian Defence Force Academy in 2008, where I studied engineering (Civil). Upon graduating from my training in 2012 I worked as a Supply Officer and in my later years specialised in Logistic Information Systems.</p>

<h2>Interest In IT:</h2>

<p>My interest in IT started when I went to university the first time. One of our early classes was in using MATLAB for doing our calculations and modelling. It was a far superior in terms of accuracy, speed, and error checking than doing work by hand and from then I was always looking for ways IT could make my work easier. I have relied upon IT systems for my whole career in logistics with experience across supply, maintenance, operations planning and finance tools. For the last two years I have been working on a large IT project, the Defence Enterprise Resource Planning program, which has led me to the decision that I would like to pursue a career more focused on IT. This decision to pursue IT is why I have commenced my studies at RMIT and specifically RMIT because it allows me to study while I work full time, though balancing the two can be hard at times. During my studies I am seeking foundational knowledge in IT as well as a better understanding of IT security and Software development. </p>
